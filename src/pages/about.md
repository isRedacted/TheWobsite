Hi, welcome to the <span style="color: burlywood; font-weight: bold;">cafe</span> on my silly website. Go ahead, pull up a seat. Actually, let me pull it up for you.

So you wanna learn all about me? Honestly, I'm touched. Flattered, even.

# Who are you?
My name is Scott, a twenty-something from <span style="color:green">Aust</span><span style="color:gold">ralia</span> who likes writing. Like, more than any normal person should. I like storytelling in any format (and truth be told, I would probably prefer TV show production if it wasn't such a hostile environment) but there's a charm to prose. Something about the sheer freedom to imagine anything sans-budget that will never not make me feel like a kid playing with their toys.

I'm recently recovering from a bout of "Every story I make has to be a novel length project even if it wouldn't work as a novel also I can't finish anything."

I'm keeping it to short stories for a while.

I'm into:
- Tech
- Nature
- Writing
- Just being a lil guy

# Why this site?
I've been writing for most of the last 5 years and very off and on before that. It's always been my hobby that I like to share with others once in a blue moon; but I've always wanted a public repository where I can just point people to to see my work. I even had an [attempt](https://aethelwulff.blogspot.com/p/home.html) a while ago to very little success (I threw it up in a day and promptly forgot about it). <sub style="font-size: 0.8rem;">[(1)](#one)</sub> So, this is take 2.

# I've got this weird mark, can you take a look?
Please put your shirt back on, we're in a public cafe.<br><br><br>

## Footnotes:
<span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
<span id="one">(1)</span> Things to note:

- I've since let the domain lapse so none of the links work anymore
- Yes I went by "Ã†thelwulf" at one point
